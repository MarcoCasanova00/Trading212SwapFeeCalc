Trading 212 CFD Swap Fee Calculator

just an exercise in coding and an utility for myself.




swap_fee_calculator.py - CLI EXECUTABLE WITH PYTHON 
It has a primitive way of saving values for stocks used often but I will remove 
it as swap fees change constantly
- a tKinter version with a gui, which will be multiplatform will come soon.

for now I have uploaded a win32 GUI application only, other than the python
 executable in CLI (this won't save stocks that you use often cause it's something that isn't needed after all)
