Trading 212 CFD Swap Fee Calculator

just an exercise in coding and an utility for myself.


swap_fee_calculator.py - CLI EXECUTABLE WITH PYTHON 

- a tKinter version with a gui, which will be multiplatform will come soon.
- a VB6 made windows EXE for now I have uploaded a win32 GUI application only, other than the python
 executable in CLI
